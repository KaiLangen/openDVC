# Common
- MACRO define luma channel sizes (height x width) corresponding to CIF standards (352 x 288)
- MACRO define chroma channel sizes (height x width) corresponding to QCIF standards (156 x 144)
- remove _frameWidth and _frameHeight as codec fields and replace with macros
- MACRO define channel offsets


# Encoder changes
- add pipelines for chroma channels, duplicating the current pipeline:
    use CIF size for Y and QCIF for UV;
    pipeline consists of 1) residual encoding, 2) 4x4 DCT, 3) 4x4 quantization, and 4) LDPCA;
      1)    can simply subtract entire frame from reference frame
      2+3)  can reuse the same transform block sizes for all three channels
            (do not need MB's to coincide with one another)
      4)    can use the CIF ladder file ("ldpca/6336_regDeg3.lad") for luma
            and QCIF ladder file ("ldpca/1584_regDeg3.lad") for chroma
           

- add new bitstreams for UV (and wz files???)
- use single frame buffer for each frame but increase size


# Decoder changes
- add SI generation and decoder pipelines for chroma channels
- use MCI for first layer and MC for upper layers
  (for MC, use MULTI method, with TSS. Quickly implement and compare ES)
- luma-first, use full-pixel search
- chroma-first, use half-pel precision search

# test programs
- ensure that at each stage, a full frame is recoverable. Check:
  1) after wz -= k -> wz += k,
  2) after -k -> DCT -> iDCT -> +k,
  3) after -k -> DCT -> Q -> iQ -> iDCT -> +k,
  4) after -k -> DCT -> Q -> LDPCA -> iLDPCA -> iQ -> iDCT ->+k,
